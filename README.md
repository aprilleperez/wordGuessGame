# Thank U, GUESS! – A Word Guessing Game

## Description
The goal of this assignmet was to create a word-guessing/hangman type of game using Javascript programming and HTML/CSS DOM manipulations for a seamless and recognizable experience for the player. Each game has a theme that the game is based off of, and begins when the user presses a key. The pressed key then either appears as part of the word, or moved to incorrect letters.

## Languages Used
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, GoogleFonts, Javascript

## Composition
Game title/how-to-play, random word to be guessed, area for incorrectly guessed letters, area tracking how many guesses are left for that word, and win/loss tracker dependent on result of game.
