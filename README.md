# wordGuessGame - Thank U, GUESS!

# Description
The goal of this assignmet was to create a word-guessing/hangman type of game using Javascript programming and HTML/CSS DOM manipulations for a seamless and recognizable experience for the player. Each game has a theme that the game is based off of, and begins when the user presses a key. The pressed key then either appears as part of the word, or moved to incorrect letters.

# Languages Used
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, GoogleFonts, Javascript

# Composition
Game title/how-to-play, random word to be guessed, area for incorrectly guessed letters, area tracking how many guesses are left for that word, and win/loss tracker dependent on result of game.

# Takeaways
This assignment was a HUGE struggling and learning experience. My personal approach was: construct the barebones structure of the HTML (setting up the composition above) and styling it with Bootstrap. I added in custom CSS at the end, once the JS was fully functioning to the specifications I wanted. The bulk of this assignment was based off of the seamless function of the game, powered through JS. I learned that I am very new and very rocky at grasping the concepts of JS, but with enough time spent into coding this game, I found myself understanding bits and pieces at a time. This also taught me to celebrate when even the small things work, and if a new bug appeared, because that means I am one step closer to creating a working application. Having this assignment be the first intimate experience I've had with using a programming language, I identified that my trouble point is thinking like a computer/executing those thoughts in a way that a computer can understand. However, at the end of it, I also realized that I created an entire game from nothing.

# Feedback
The game works to what I was expecting it to do, but for future edits I'd want to consider a more sophisticated way to notify the user whether they won or not. I would also like to spend more time eventually creating other dynamically changing elements for aesthetics/fun effect. Overall, my main feedback isn't the end game itself, but rather thinking through problem-solving how to get the variables to work.
